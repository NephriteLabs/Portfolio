## Concept
The concept revolves around using statistical methods to assess the properties of the datasets and to test hypotheses in IBM SPSS. <br/>

### The project included:<br/>

Normality Tests: Assessing whether the variables follow a normal distribution.<br/>
ANOVA: Comparing means across multiple groups to see if there are significant differences.<br/>
T-Tests: Comparing means between two groups to determine if they are statistically different.<br/>

## Dataset
The datasets are contained in SPSS output files:<br/>

Normality of variables ("variables.spv"): Contains results of normality tests on specified variables.<br/>
ANOVA results ("Step 3-4_ANOVA.spv"): Contains results of ANOVA tests conducted on various groups.<br/>
T-Test results ("Step 3-4_T-Test.spv"): Contains results of T-Tests comparing means between two groups.<br/>

## Skills and technologies

- IBM SPSS: Used for performing statistical analysis and generating reports.
- Statistical methods: Knowledge of normality tests, ANOVA, and T-Tests.
- Data interpretation: Interpret statistical results and understand their implications.

## Development
Development involved the following steps:

1. Data Preparation: Ensured data is properly formatted and suitable for analysis in SPSS.<br/>
2. Normality Tests: Used SPSS to run normality tests (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov).<br/>
3. Conducted ANOVA: Used SPSS to perform ANOVA, comparing means across multiple groups.<br/>
4. Conducted T-Tests: Used SPSS to perform T-Tests to compare means between two groups.<br/>
5. Report Generation: Exported results from SPSS and interpreted the findings.<br/>
