## Concept
The overall goal of this project was to choose an optimal location for oil drilling and production in New Mexico. The project involved comprehensive analysis of geological, drilling, completion, and production aspects to maximize oil recovery efficiently and economically.

The project required a multidisciplinary approach, integrating various aspects of engineering and economic calculations, while minimising costs and environmental impact.

### The project included:

- Geological and reservoir analysis
- Drilling plan and casing design
- Completion strategy, including hydraulic fracturing
- Production forecasting and economic evaluation
- Facilities design and planning

## Dataset
The project utilises various datasets, including geological maps (net thickness map), fluid properties data (pressure, recovery %, free gas, GOR), production data (initial rates, decline rates), economic parameters (working interest, royalty burden, costs), well logging data, and fracturing and completion data.

## Skills and Technologies

- Geological data interpretation and mapping
- Engineering methods (volumetric calculations, material balance, production forecasting etc)
- Economic analysis (NPV calculations, sensitivity analysis)


## Development

1. Geology/OOIP/Recovery Efficiency:
- Analysed net thickness map to determine optimal drilling locations
- Calculated Original Oil in Place (OOIP) using volumetric methods
- Estimated recovery efficiency based on reservoir properties and production data

2. Drilling:
- Designed casing program considering formation pressures and regulations
- Calculated cement volumes for each casing string
- Developed time vs. depth summary for drilling operations <br/>

3. Completion:
- Designed hydraulic fracturing treatment (fluid volumes, proppant amounts)
- Determined perforation strategy
- Estimated stimulation costs

4. Production Function:
- Analysed initial production rates and decline characteristics
- Developed production forecasts using decline curve analysis
- Considered water-oil ratio (WOR) trends for production life <br/>

5. Facilities:
- Created preliminary single-well flow chart design
- Included provisions for testing, separation, and disposal
- Considered changes in production rates over time

6. Financial Analysis:
- Incorporated working interest, royalty burdens, and assigned burdens
- Calculated drilling, completion, and facilities costs
- Performed economic analysis to determine project viability
