## Concept
This project showcases comprehensive data analysis on a dataset of vehicles to extract meaningful insights and answer various business questions. This includes calculating descriptive statistics, visualising data distributions, identifying correlations, and conducting hypothesis tests.

### The project included:
- Data import and exploration
- Descriptive statistics and insights
- Data visualisation
- Statistical analysis
- Correlation analysis

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes a variety of attributes related to vehicles, such as MSRP, engine horsepower, vehicle styles, transmission types, fuel types, and more. With more than 11 thousand rows it provides a rich source of information to explore different aspects of vehicle characteristics and performance.<br/>

## Skills and Technologies
- Python: Data manipulation and analysis
- Pandas: Handling and processing the dataset
- Numpy: Numerical operations
- Matplotlib: Creating visualisations
- Seaborn: Advanced data visualisation on top of matplotlib
- Scipy: Statistical tests and calculations
- Textwrap: Formatting text outputs
- Warnings: Managing warning messages during execution

## Development
The development process involved several key steps:

1. Data Loading and Cleaning:
- Read the data from CSV files and loaded it into a Pandas DataFrame
- Set display options for better readability
- Identified and handled missing values where necessary

2. Descriptive Analysis:

- Computed basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quantiles
- Investigated the distribution of different attributes using bar plots and histograms
- Analszed correlations between various features using correlation coefficients

3. Hypothesis Testing:

- Formulated and tested hypotheses using t-tests to determine significant differences between groups
- Analysed the results of the tests and interpreted the p-values to make informed decisions

4. Data Visualisation:

- Created a variety of plots (scatter plots, box plots, histograms) to visually explore the data
- Enhanced the readability of plots with labels, titles, and legends

5. Outlier Detection:

- Used z-score analysis to identify and visualise potential outliers in the dataset
- Confirmed the presence of outliers in attributes such as Engine HP and highway MPG

6. Final Analysis:

- Combined visual and statistical analysis to draw comprehensive insights
- Summarised the findings and presented them in an easy-to-understand format
