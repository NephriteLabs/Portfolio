## Concept
The project aimed to analyse the relationship between gender and confidence levels in responses, utilising statistical methods to determine if these variables are independent or dependent.

### The project included:
- Conducting chi-squared tests for independence and goodness-of-fit
- Analysing response distributions by gender
- Interpreting the significance of the findings

## Dataset
The dataset comprised responses from 792 individuals, evenly split between genders, categorised into four confidence levels: very confident, somewhat confident, not too confident, and not at all confident.<br/>
