## Concept
The project involved analysing data from various sources, including student majors, household income, and hierarchical clustering of schools.

## Dataset

- Major Frequencies: Data from university seniors regarding their majors.
- Household Data: Information on household ownership and utilities across different locations.
- Clustering Data: School data including stadium capacity, latitude, longitude, and enrollment.

## Skills and Technologies
Data analysis techniques, including pivot tables and hierarchical clustering. Used various statistical methods to calculate frequencies, ownership percentages, and distances between clusters.

## Development
1. Conducted surveys and data collection for major frequencies.
2. Analysed household data for economic insights.
3. Implemented hierarchical clustering using various linkage methods to identify patterns in school data.<br/>
