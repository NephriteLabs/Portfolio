## Concept:
The overall goal of this project was to choose an optimal location for oil drilling and production in New Mexico. The project involved comprehensive analysis of geological, drilling, completion, and production aspects to maximize oil recovery efficiently and economically.

### The project included:

- Geological and reservoir analysis
- Drilling plan and casing design
- Completion strategy, including hydraulic fracturing
- Production forecasting and economic evaluation
- Facilities design and planning

## Dataset:
The project utilises various datasets, including:
- Geological maps (net thickness map)
- Fluid properties data (pressure, recovery %, free gas, GOR)
- Production data (initial rates, decline rates)
- Economic parameters (working interest, royalty burden, costs)
- Well logging data
- Fracturing and completion data

## Skills and technologies:


Geological interpretation and mapping
Reservoir engineering (volumetric calculations, material balance)
Drilling engineering (casing design, cement calculations)
Completion engineering (hydraulic fracturing design)
Production engineering (decline curve analysis, production forecasting)
Economic analysis (NPV calculations, sensitivity analysis)
Facilities engineering (preliminary design and flow charts)


Development:
a) Geology/OOIP/Recovery Efficiency:


Analyze net thickness map to determine optimal drilling locations
Calculate Original Oil in Place (OOIP) using volumetric methods
Estimate recovery efficiency based on reservoir properties and production data

b) Drilling:

Design casing program considering formation pressures and regulations
Calculate cement volumes for each casing string
Develop time vs. depth summary for drilling operations

c) Completion:

Design hydraulic fracturing treatment (fluid volumes, proppant amounts)
Determine perforation strategy
Estimate stimulation costs

d) Production Function:

Analyze initial production rates and decline characteristics
Develop production forecasts using decline curve analysis
Consider water-oil ratio (WOR) trends for production life

e) Facilities:

Create preliminary single-well flow chart design
Include provisions for testing, separation, and disposal
Consider changes in production rates over time

f) Financial Analysis:

Incorporate working interest, royalty burdens, and assigned burdens
Calculate drilling, completion, and facilities costs
Perform economic analysis to determine project viability

The project requires a multidisciplinary approach, integrating various aspects of petroleum engineering to optimize oil recovery while minimizing costs and environmental impact. The team will need to collaborate closely to ensure all technical areas are addressed comprehensively for successful project execution.
