## Concept:
This project focused on data manipulation using the Pandas library in Python. It demonstrates various operations and techniques for working with structured data in a tabular format.

The project included:
1. Creating a database of horse breeds
- Manipulating and analysing the dataset using Pandas
- Demonstrating various data manipulation techniques
- Visualising and exporting the processed data

## Dataset:
The project uses a custom-created dataset about horse breeds. It includes information such as:
- Breed names
- Country of origin
- Height and weight
- Temperament
- Historical significance
- Brief description
- Color (added later in the notebook)

Skills and technologies:
1. Python programming
2. Pandas library for data manipulation
3. Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding and documentation
4. Data analysis techniques (filtering, sorting, grouping)
5. Ddata visualisation
6. Data export to CSV and Excel

## Development:
The notebook progresses through several stages:

1. Data Creation and Import:
   - Importing the Pandas library
   - Creating a dictionary-based dataset
   - Converting the dictionary to a Pandas DataFrame

2. Basic Data Exploration:
   - Displaying the entire DataFrame
   - Using head() and tail() functions
   - Generating summary statistics with describe()

3. Data Selection:
   - Accessing specific columns and rows
   - Using loc[] and iloc[] for data selection
   - Selecting multiple columns and rows

4. Data Modification:
   - Adding a new column (Color)
   - Updating specific values in the DataFrame

5. Data Analysis:
   - Sorting data based on specific columns
   - Grouping data and applying aggregate functions
   - Filtering data using boolean conditions and the query() method

6. Data Export:
   - Exporting the DataFrame to a CSV file
   - (Commented out) Exporting to an Excel file

Throughout the notebook, there's a focus on demonstrating different Pandas functions and methods, showing how to manipulate and analyze structured data effectively.
